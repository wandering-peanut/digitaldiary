**$49 round trip** 

I found a $49 round-trip ticket to LA that arrived Saturday night and departed the next evening. 

Disclaimer: I strongly despise LAX due to the unnecessary amount of traffic there is. I have never experienced an airport like this before. 

Once landing, I had to take a 10 minute bus that went through the runway prior to leaving the arrivals gate. Due to the ridiculous traffic, I then took the Hilton shuttle just to get out of the airport. Luckily, a cute boy picked me so all was good.

**5 bowls of ramen**

Michael had wanted to take me to a tofu soup joint but it was unfortunately closed by the time we got there. With limited options, we opted for a nearby restaurant that supposedly had a special Chashu ramen. To our surprise, the restaurant only serves FIVE bowls of that special ramen a day. 

The ramen we chose was not bad, but the takoyaki was especially mid (doughy with minimal filling).

**Sunday**

On Sunday, we woke up and headed towards Japantown. We went to the mochi store (Fugetsu-Do) and picked up 4 pieces of mochi and a box of peanut butter mochi. Afterwards, we walked over to Okayama Kobo Bakery and got the curry pan, sausage bun, rose matcha latte, and mentaiko butter roll. The sausage bun and rose matcha latte were disappointing, but the curry pan and mentaiko butter roll were especially delicious. By the time we stepped outside, it had already started raining. Luckily, a nearby figurine store sold umbrellas, so we picked one up.

Michael had it all planned out - The next stop was the Disney Concert Hall! He got us rush tickets to see the LA Phil for $20 each (online the tickets were going up to $200 for our seats). He photoshopped our college transcripts & even got us the student discount. Between getting the tickets and the show, we went to the Getty museum. The original location we ended up in was the hike up to the Getty, so we took a 15 minute detour to get to the correct location. 

I’d like to go back to the Getty again sometime, we skimmed through it due to time restrictions but it was fascinating.

**Private Listening Room** 

Who knew that everyone would arrive on time to see the symphony perform? We arrived approximately 10 minutes late and were told we could not enter the performance until intermission. However, they offered us a private listening room experience— a secluded space with a personal staff member present, a slight crack in the wall to hear the live music, and a small TV (which frequently glitches) displaying the symphony performance. 

Can you believe it was just the two of us? We couldn’t stop laughing because the situation was hilarious. The more I tried to hold it in, the harder I laughed, and I kept laughing until tears were streaming down my face.

After intermission, we headed to our seats. Shortly after, Michael fell asleep. The concert hall was so beautiful and the pianist was so good!

**Northern Cafe**

For an early dinner & to celebrate Lunar New Year, we ate at Northern Cafe. Unfortunately, they did not have skewers but we ordered fish, beef noodle soup, seaweed side dish, pig ears, potato side dish, and spicy wontons.

Michael said it made his stomach upset afterwards but I was okay. The cold seaweed and potato side dish, as well as the fish, were my favorites.

We quickly headed back towards LAX after our meal where I headed back to the bay. I hadn't laughed like that in a long time, and I think Michael did a fantastic job planning our date.
