**Valentines Weekend**
This past weekend was filled with lots of sweet memories and laughter.
It all began on Valentine's Day when Michael surprised me with a beautiful bouquet delivered to my apartment. To my suprise, another bouquet arrived at my office, a delivery that was meant to come the day before, making it a double surprise in one day. He is the sweetest boy ever. 
The next day, I had lunch with my dad in the Outer Sunset at Damnfine Pizza. We split a pizza and a calamari, the calamari was extra yummy. The plan was to grab boba after, but my dad’s curiosity got the best of us when noticing a long line at the Dubai Chocolate Strawberry shop next door. My dad wanted to try it out, so while I ordered a milk tea, he opted for the strawberries with a 30 minute wait. I was almost late for my flight as we weren’t expecting such a long wait, but it was delicious!

Off to LA!

Michael had been planning a surprise date, so I was excited to see what he had in store. My guess was sushi, and I was right, but I never expected it to be Omakase! It was my first time having Omakase, and the experience was incredible. We tried so many different types of fish, or favorites being the ikura, sasaki, umi, amaebi, and chutoro. The monkfish liver and shirako were very interesting. The monkfish liver tasted like blended pinto beans, and the shirako's exterior texture was not Michael's cup of tea.
After dinner, we exchanged gifts. I gave him a card I made and a necklace, while he surprised me with a gorgeous personalized Pandora bracelet (it had a drawing of a peanut and dumpling). We stopped by Pandora to adjust the size and stumbled upon a photo booth, where we took some cute photos.

The next morning, Michael wanted to introduce me to Fujian-style breakfast, with peanut butter noodles and wonton soup. Unfortunately, the noodles were watery and lacked flavor, which disappointed Michael. After breakfast, we explored the LA Arboretum, a peaceful botanical garden. This turned out to be the funniest part of the weekend. We found fruit trees scattered throughout, and Michael couldn't resist picking oranges, kumquats, and grapefruits. At one point, he struck up a conversation with an older lady also picking kumquats, and we sat at the benches peeling and tasting fruit. It was my first time trying kumquats, it was pretty good!

In the afternoon, we stopped by the mall to try warabi mochi from a place Michael had been eyeing. Oak + Fort was having a sale, so I picked up a sweater to leave at Michael’s apartment, and he grabbed a t-shirt and pants. The sweater is basically his now since he's been wearing it nonstop.
On my last day, we played pickleball at the local park in the morning. Michael won both games (although I am ambidextrous, I am not very skilled), but it was still so much fun. Afterward, we grabbed coffee at a cafe in K-Town. The kinako latte, grapefruit refresher, and strawberry croffle were delumptious. For our dinner, we had Chinese skewers with a Korean fusion twist, complete with little banchan plates to start. Michael wanted to try the sweet and sour pork, so he asked the girl next to one for a piece. We traded for a slice of our seafood pancake.
Before heading to the airport, we squeezed in one last stop at Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook. The skyline was the perfect ending to such a wonderful weekend.
