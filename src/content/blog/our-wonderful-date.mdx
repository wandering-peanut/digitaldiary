**The airport**

Michael visited last weekend for the first time since moving to LA—we hadn’t seen each other in two weeks!　　
While waiting at the airport, a rude driver backed into my car. When I stepped out to check, he yelled, “Yo, calm down, I’m three feet away!” He kept raising his voice, insisting my car was supposed to shake at an airport. Then he reversed again, blocking me in—not realizing I planned to wait there anyway. With no airport staff directing traffic, I got to stay put for 20 minutes.

**The Beach**

After picking up Michael, we headed to Takahashi Market for BAM & Egg Musubi, Unagi Musubi, Tako Poke, squid chips, and Royal Milk Tea. On the way to Half Moon Bay, we stopped at a plant store to admire the quirky succulents.
We set up a picnic at the beach and munched on the musubi—easily the best we’ve had (11/10). The fog cleared by the afternoon, giving us the perfect view.

**Sunset**

We had planned to hike for sunset, but the fog blocked our view. Instead, we sat on a nice bench, ate my grandma’s cookies, and enjoyed the view of the plants (within a 3-foot vicinity). Later, we grabbed dinner at a handroll bar with my parents before heading home.

**The next day**

We started the morning with brunch at Lapisara Eatery, sharing a crab scramble and fried chicken benedict. Our original plan was Swan Oyster Depot, but the line was so long.
Later, we visited Sweet Glory, an adorable café with a strange no-laptops-on-weekends rule. We tried a passionfruit refresher, matcha Jeju hallabong, and an out-of-this-world passionfruit crepe cake. Once in season, we will try the mango one. While Michael worked on his own tasks, I read a book and browsed Zillow. I found a studio with a stunning view and inquired about it.
We then walked through Golden Gate Park, dancing to music from a random DJ. Before seeing Wicked at 6:30, Michael picked up San Tung to-go, and we quickly toured the apartment I had inquired about. The view was gorgeous but out of budget ($2,300/month). 

What a wonderful weekend!
