## Hello World

Time has flown by â€“ it's already the fourteenth day of 2025. That's 3.84% of the year, which is honestly quite a lot considering
all I've done so far is simply think about everything I'd like to get done this year. I've spent quite a lot of time (frankly too much time) trying
to start a blog in order to better document my life & organize my thoughts. After looking into various platforms, my boyfriend told me that I could try use github. 
Unfortunately, coding is a foreign concept to me & after looking through the tutorials I was still completely lost. Feeling defeated, I let my pride go & asked him for help.
I am happy to say that after a few hours of diligent work, he has now got this blog up and running!

**How I started my year**

I caught a bug on New Year's Eve and inevitably I searched on Google: "Is it bad luck to get sick on New Year's Eve?"
Suprisingly the internet was full of relieving thoughts, but I felt silly for searching it up in the first place.

Outside of what's uncontrollable, I'm generally in charge of my life. So, as one does at the beginning of each year, I've made some 
goals for myself this year that I'd like to achieve. I'm still trying to condense this list, but I think I have the general gist (updates in the near future to come).

By the morning of the new year, I was back to my usual self. My mother set up a beautiful traditional breakfast for New Year's Day. The food was carefully plated with each dish symbolizing its own positive message.
Michael drove his 15ft U-Haul down from the city & joined us for breakfast. Afterwards, he took a nap on the massage chair while Gina and I went on a boba run to Tastea (my brother was also taking a nap). 

**The drive to LA**

At around 4pm, we were ready to embark on our journey to LA. Having dreamed of becoming a truck driver in my childhood, I was thrilled to finally get behind the wheel.
We were off to a bumpy start as the door flew open on its own while we were on the highway. As cars beeped at us and made hand signals that seemed to resemble a thumbs up, Michael, an optimist, had concluded
that the cars were telling us we were doing a good job. After a few honks, we concluded that the cars were trying to communicate something else to us. We pulled over to the side of the highway and noticed the trunk was wide
open. Luckily nothing fell out, but it was a close call.

The rest of the 7 hour drive went smoothly. The gas tank only needed to be filled up once which was pretty surprising considering how heavy the truck was. For dinner, we opted for In n Out, a classic. By 11pm,
we were in LA! 11/10 experience. Also, remember the boba I mentioned earlier? It lasted me the whole ride & more!

**In LA**

As Michael was getting settled in his new apartment and office, I was working remotely for a few days. I was grateful for the natural light his room gets as my room in the city gets minimal light. 

We went on a lot of cute dates over the course of a few days:
1- Kazunori for dinner followed by a walk at Venice Beach while we ate our customized Coldstone ice cream (oreo sweet cream + kit kats, twix, & cookie dough). Michael says that our order deserves to be added to their official menu.
2- Sunset run at Manhattan Beach. About a mile in, we accidentally got our shoes wet so we went on a barefoot run on the sand. 
3- Bento from Tokyo Central while watching Squid Games. We finished all of season 2 over the course of 3 days.
4- Pastries from Cream Pan at the park! We tried the strawberry cream pastry, yakisoba pan, chicken urry pan, and iced matcha. The curry pan and iced matcha was our favorite.

The year started off on a wonderful note, and despite the sadness of going back home, I felt very loved and content.


**Back Home**

I don't have too much to report on here. As usual, my apartment searching obsession has continued. I even got catfished by a $700 ADU that looked nothing like the photo. The second I stepped in,
I felt a shiver down my spine and toes. The ADU unit was designed like a speakeasy, hidden behind the door of a plastic outdoor storage box. This was a wake up call for me to momentarily stop the search. I had 
spent an hour an a half round trip via the bus just to get catfished. 

My search for an apartment unit continues due to habit, but I'm honestly pretty happy with my current situation. More to come!
