Hello world, I am playing a game of catch up in this post. There are a lot of memories that I would like to capture.

**Lunar New Years Warriors Game**

January 29th, 2025 - Michael booked a flight to the city as he needed to come pack up a robot he had purchased. It took him all day to pack the robot and he didn’t even get the chance to eat a meal!

My brother had invited us to go to the Warriors vs. Thunder game, so we met up with him at Gotts’ right outside the Chase Center. We ate a double cheeseburger and shared fries - it was delumptious! I was excited to go to the game as I’ve never been to an NBA game before. This was a particularly special game as it was Lunar New Year themed. The Warriors started rusty but eventually got in the zone and won. I must say it was a pretty stressful experience watching it all go down live. I would like to go back to another game sometime!

Super Bowl Sunday

I had my first-ever business trip over in Washington DC and Virginia at the beginning of February. On my way back, I stopped in LA for a night to go see Michael. He picked me up and drove us to a Pho spot as I had mentioned I was craving it (how sweet of him). The spring rolls were particularly delumptious. I ordered bun bo hue for the first time and Michael got a classic beef pho. 

The next morning, we went on a run at Hermosa Beach and then got acai bowls from Oakberry Acai. I still think about that acai bowl to this day, it was SO good. While we sat and ate, we pre-ordered some Papa Johns pizza for the Super Bowl. Afterwards, we soaked up the sun by playing our version of Volleyball (we couldn’t get the ball over the net). When we walked back to the car, a parking ticket was there, waiting for us.

Michael invited his college friend to come watch the Super Bowl with us at his apartment. We only watched from the halftime show which turned out to be a good choice as the Chiefs lost big time. When we picked up the pizza before watching the game, Papa Johns was packed. Although we pre-ordered the pizza, we had to wait an additional 30 minutes. When someone in front of us inquired about ordering, they were told they weren’t taking orders for at least two hours! What a busy day for them.

After watching the game, Michael dropped me off at the infamous LAX and I headed back to the city!
