**One step at a time**

I often find myself stuck, focused too much on the bigger picture. This approach may work for some, but for me, it hinders my progress in almost everything I do. 

This week, I have begun to implement intentionality into my daily life. Rather than being over-fixated on the end goal, I am shifting my mindset to engage in the steps that come along the way.

Let’s take today for example. It’s the end of the day and I am feeling good about the way I spent my time. I opened up my notebook and jotted down a few goals and challenges that I knew could be achieved while working from home.

**Challenge #1: See how many steps I could walk while WFH.**

The answer: 1,000 steps.

This may not be the most impressive metric at first glance because it isn’t. It didn’t require much effort. I had subconsciously thought about this throughout the day and I simply sprinkled around the act of walking in place.

Now if I could challenge myself every to do this while working every day, I could probably find myself seeing the “bigger picture”. Apparently there are about 260 week days per calendar year. This would accumulate to 260,000 steps and according to thecalculatorsite.com, I’d be getting in an additional 110 miles (adjusted to my height). With 110 miles, that would add up to me walking from San Francisco to Monterey.

**Challenge #2: Don’t sit down!**

I usually sit down, so I took away my chair and put my standing desk to use. Mission accomplished.

**Challenge #3: Drink more water**

I have a bad habit of dehydrating myself so I took a tally for each 16oz glass of water I completed while working. This motivated me to drink 5 glasses of water (80 ounces) which is much more than I usually drink. 

P.S. I drank more water after work too but I didn’t keep track!

**Challenge #4: Fix my posture while reading book**

Again, mission accomplished. As I took short breaks throughout my day, I read a section of my book while standing against the wall fixing my posture.

**Challenge #5: Continue running at least one mile a day**

Similar to my philosophy from Challenge #1, one mile a day adds up to 365 miles a year. This may seem like an easy thing to do, but as a non-runner, it really is not easy! 

Every day makes a difference and even just a week of lagging behind will result in having to catch up with a 7 mile run (to average to a mile a day). Last year I felt like I went on a lot of runs, but it turns out I only ran 180 miles. 

Since I wanted to make time for baking today, I opted for the simple mile and then walked over to the grocery store to buy some flour & baking soda (for the banana bread). I'm still 3 miles short of reaching my goal of averaging 1 mile per day, but we're not too far off.

**Challenge #6: Make food I enjoy**

Breakfast -  Matcha oatmeal with greek yogurt.

Lunch - Bulgogi beef stir-fried with kimchi and rice cakes, on top of salad.

Dinner - Spicy seafood tofu soup.

Dessert - I had over ripe bananas so I baked banana bread!
